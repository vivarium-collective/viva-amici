"""Optional ``@composite_generator`` shim.

When ``pbg_superpowers`` is installed (the vivarium-workbench runtime), the
real decorator registers each generator with the dashboard's discovery
machinery. When it isn't, we fall back to a no-op so the module still
imports and the decorated functions remain directly callable.
